## The Biology Your Students Will Actually Use

**Picture your student in 2035.**

They're not memorizing the Krebs cycle.

They're **building computational models** to predict drug interactions.

They're **analyzing genomic networks** to understand disease.

They're **engineering synthetic biological circuits** to produce clean energy.

**That's not science fiction. That's actual biology.**

And the foundation for all of it? **The systems thinking skills you're teaching right now.**

## What Nobody Tells You About the Future of Biology

**Traditional biology education prepares students for biology careers that no longer exist.**

**The skills that mattered in 1990**:
- Memorize biochemical pathways
- Run gel electrophoresis
- Identify specimens under a microscope
- Dissect organisms

**The skills that matter in 2025**:
- Model complex biological networks
- Analyze large datasets computationally
- Predict emergent system behaviors
- Integrate data across scales (molecules to organisms)
- Communicate findings through data visualization

**One of these skill sets opens doors to modern biology careers. Guess which one.**

## The Four Careers Your Students Are Training For (Right Now)

**When you teach computational modeling and systems thinking, you're preparing students for fields that didn't exist when you were in school.**

### Career Path 1: Computational Biologist 💻

---

**Notice the pattern?**

**Every skill these careers require, your students are learning through computational modeling.**

**Not "kind of similar." EXACTLY the same.**

## Why Universities Are Scrambling to Teach What You're Already Teaching

**Here's a secret**: College biology programs are **way behind** K-12 computational modeling education.

**Most university biology majors**:
- Take traditional lecture courses
- Run cookbook labs
- Memorize facts for exams
- Graduate without ever building a computational model

**Then they hit grad school or industry and realize**: "Wait, I need to know systems biology and computational modeling?"

**So they take remedial courses. Or struggle. Or switch fields.**

---

**But YOUR students?**

They've been **building models since middle school.**

They understand **feedback loops, network effects, emergent behavior.**

They can **design experiments, test hypotheses, analyze data computationally.**

**They show up to college biology already ahead.**

**That's powerful.**

## The Research Revolution Happening Right Now

**Biology is undergoing the same transformation physics had in the 20th century**: Moving from descriptive science to predictive, computational, mathematical science.

### The Old Biology (Pre-2000s)

**Approach**: Study one gene, one protein, one pathway at a time

**Questions**: "What does this protein do?"

**Methods**: Knockout experiments, biochemical assays, microscopy

**Limits**: Can't understand complex systems with many interacting parts

### The New Biology (2000s-Present)

**Approach**: Study networks, systems, interactions across scales

**Questions**: "How do thousands of components work together to create behavior?"

**Methods**: Computational modeling, network analysis, systems biology

**Power**: Can predict emergent behaviors, design interventions, understand disease

---

**Examples of what's possible now** (that wasn't possible before):

1. **Cancer Treatment Prediction**: Model a patient's tumor signaling network → Predict which drug combinations will work → Personalized therapy

2. **Pandemic Response**: Model disease spread through population networks → Test intervention strategies computationally → Optimize public health policy

3. **Synthetic Biofuels**: Model metabolic pathways in bacteria → Engineer optimized circuits → Produce clean energy from waste

4. **Precision Medicine**: Model drug interactions across genetic backgrounds → Predict side effects before clinical trials → Safer medications

**All of this requires systems thinking and computational modeling.**

**All of this is what your students are learning.**

## What Your Principal Needs to Hear (Script This)

**When your principal asks**: "Why are we spending time on this?"

**Here's what you say**:

> "The National Academy of Sciences, the NIH, and the NSF have all published reports saying that **systems thinking and computational modeling are essential skills for 21st-century biology**. We're not adding something extra—we're teaching the biology that colleges and careers actually need.
>
> Our students are building the same types of models that researchers at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln use to study cancer and immune diseases. They're learning to think like computational biologists—and those skills apply whether they go into medicine, research, biotech, or data science.
>
> This isn't a pilot program. This is where biology education is headed. And our students are ahead of the curve."

**Then show them a student model. Show them the CER arguments. Show them the simulation data.**

**Principals don't argue with results.**

## How to Keep the Momentum Going (Your Year 2 Playbook)

**You've spent 10 weeks learning about computational modeling.**

**Now what?**

**Here's the roadmap for embedding this into your teaching practice permanently:**

### Quarter 1: Start Small (1-2 Models)

**Introduce modeling with simple systems**:
- Gene regulation (lac operon)
- Enzyme feedback (product inhibition)
- Basic homeostasis (glucose-insulin)

**Goal**: Students get comfortable with the interface and workflow

**Time investment**: 2-3 class periods total

### Quarter 2: Build Complexity (3-5 Models)

**Move to multi-component systems**:
- Cell cycle control
- Signaling pathways
- Metabolic networks

**Goal**: Students handle more nodes, feedback loops, and perturbations

**Time investment**: 1 modeling activity every 2-3 weeks

### Quarter 3: Collaborative Projects (2-3 Team Models)

**Implement group modeling**:
- Cellular respiration (4 teams, 4 subsystems)
- Immune response (teams model different pathways)
- Ecosystem dynamics (abiotic/biotic factors)

**Goal**: Students practice collaboration, integration, peer review

**Time investment**: One major project per unit

### Quarter 4: Student-Designed Investigations (Independent Modeling)

**Let students drive**:
- They choose a biological question
- They design a model to investigate it
- They test hypotheses and present findings

**Goal**: Students become independent computational biologists

**Time investment**: Final project (2-3 weeks)

---

**By the end of the year**: Your students have built 10-15 models, run 50+ simulations, written 20+ CER arguments, and developed genuine computational thinking skills.

**That's transformative.**

## The Vision: Every Biology Classroom Is a Computational Lab

**Imagine 10 years from now:**

- Every biology teacher has modeling experience
- Every middle/high school uses Cell Collective
- Every student graduates understanding systems thinking
- Computational biology is as normal as lab dissections used to be

**That future starts with teachers like you.**

**You're the early adopters. The innovators. The ones who saw the potential and said "Yes, my students can do this."**

**And you were right.**

## Your Final Challenge: The "Systems Thinking" Test

**Ask yourself these questions. If you answer "yes" to most of them, you've successfully transformed your practice:**

✅ Do your students use the word "feedback loop" correctly?

✅ Can they explain how perturbations cascade through networks?

✅ Do they naturally ask "What if we knocked out this component?"

✅ Can they distinguish between correlation and causation in systems?

✅ Do they see biology as interconnected, not isolated facts?

✅ Can they build a simple model from scratch in 15 minutes?

✅ Do they prefer testing ideas computationally before reading the textbook answer?

✅ Can they write a CER argument using simulation data as evidence?

**If you answered yes to 6+, congratulations.**

**You've taught systems thinking. You've prepared them for the future. You've done something most biology teachers never do.**

**You've made biology REAL.**

## What We've Covered in 10 Weeks

Let's recap this journey:

**Week 1**: Why modeling matters (NGSS Practice 2, the "aha moment")

**Week 2**: The CER transformation (turning models into evidence-based arguments)

**Week 3**: NGSS alignment (how modeling hits every standard you need)

**Week 4**: Platform features (hands-on with Cell Collective)

**Week 5**: Research foundation (Dr. Helikar, UNL, peer-reviewed credibility)

**Week 6**: Systems thinking (seeing connections, feedback loops, emergence)

**Week 7**: Your first model (step-by-step 20-minute build)

**Week 8**: Multi-scale modeling (molecules → cells → organisms)

**Week 9**: Collaborative modeling (group projects that actually work)

**Week 10**: The future (why this matters for your students' careers and lives)

**You've gone from "What is computational modeling?" to "I can teach this confidently."**

**That's a huge transformation.**

**Did we deliver?**

**Check your drafts folder. Check the models you've explored. Check the ideas you've had for your classroom.**

**You have everything you need.**

## Where to Go From Here

### Option 1: Start This Week

Pick ONE concept you're teaching. Build or use a model. Try it with students. See what happens.

**You don't need permission. You don't need a curriculum overhaul. You need 15 minutes and Cell Collective.**

### Option 2: Plan for Next Unit

Identify 2-3 places where modeling would strengthen your upcoming unit. Sketch out how you'd integrate it. Try it when the unit starts.

### Option 3: Connect with Other Teachers

**You're not alone in this.** Other teachers are using Cell Collective. Find them. Share models. Swap ideas. Build a community.

**Email us. Seriously.** We want to hear how it's going. What's working. What's challenging. What your students are discovering.

**Because we're building this movement together.**
