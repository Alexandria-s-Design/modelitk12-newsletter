---

## Remember That Promise from Last Week?

We said you'd learn to:
- **Build your first model from scratch** (10 minutes)
- **Run simulations and break things** (5 minutes)
- **Get data students can use for CER arguments** (instantly)
- **Make this work with zero prep time** (really)

**Today we deliver.**

This isn't theory. This isn't "someday when I have time."

This is: **"Open Cell Collective right now and do this by lunch."**

## The 5 Game-Changing Features Nobody Tells You About

Cell Collective isn't just "educational software." It's a **full research platform** that happens to be ridiculously easy for middle schoolers to use.

Here's what that actually means for you:

### 🎯 Feature 1: The Drag-and-Drop Model Builder (Yes, Really No Coding)

**The claim**: "Students can build computational models without coding."

**The reality**: Your students will build a working gene regulation network in the time it takes to label a cell diagram.

**How it actually works**:

You're looking at a blank canvas. That's it. No intimidating code editor. No math equations. Just a canvas.

**Here's what students do**:

1. **Add components** - Click "Add Component." Type "Glucose." Boom. There's a node.
2. **Connect them** - Drag an arrow from "Glucose" to "Insulin." You just said "Glucose activates Insulin."
3. **Define the logic** - Click "Insulin" and set the rule: "ON when Glucose is ON." That's it.
4. **Click Simulate** - Watch it come alive.

**Total time**: 5-7 minutes for a simple 3-component network.

**What students actually learn**:
- How to think about **cause and effect** as connections
- How to make assumptions **explicit** (the rule IS the assumption)
- How to **test ideas** by changing connections

**NGSS Practice 2: ✅ Develop a model** - Students literally built the structure and behavior of a system.

#### The "Wait, What Just Happened?" Moment

Picture this:

Your student Jamal adds "LacI Repressor" and connects it to "mRNA Production" with an **inhibition** arrow.

You ask: "What happens when LacI is high?"

Jamal: "mRNA should go down, right?"

You: "Test it."

He sets LacI to ON, clicks Simulate, and watches mRNA flatline.

**His face**: 😮

**That's when it clicks.** Models aren't abstract. They're **testable predictions you can see**.

### 🎯 Feature 2: 1000+ Pre-Built Models You Can Use Tomorrow

**The claim**: "There's a library of validated models."

**The reality**: There's a **massive library** of real research models covering everything from cellular respiration to cancer signaling.

**And you can use them right now.**

**Here's how**:

1. Go to the Cell Collective website
2. Click "Browse Models"
3. Search for your topic: "cell cycle," "immune response," "enzyme regulation"
4. Click "Open"
5. **You're in.** No installation. No account setup (for browsing). Just... there.

**What you'll find**:

Models built by actual researchers. With citations. With notes explaining "This protein activates this pathway because of [this 2018 study]."

**This isn't Khan Academy.** This is **real science** that happens to have a teacher-friendly interface.

#### The Smart Move: Start With a Library Model

Don't build from scratch on Day 1.

**Better approach**:
1. Find a library model for your topic
2. Open it with your class
3. **Explore together**: "What happens if we knock out this gene?"
4. Let students propose changes
5. **Then** have them build their own simplified version

**Why this works**: Students see a "real" model first. They understand what they're building toward. They're not guessing.

### 🎯 Feature 3: Simulations That Actually Simulate

**The claim**: "Students run simulations to test hypotheses."

**The reality**: Click one button and watch 50 time steps of network dynamics unfold in a graph.

**This is the magic moment.**

Your static network **comes alive**.

- Nodes turn on and off
- Signals propagate through the network
- Feedback loops kick in
- Oscillations emerge
- Steady states are reached

**And students see it all in real-time.**

**The basic workflow**:

1. **Baseline run** - Click "Simulate" to see normal behavior
2. **Make a prediction** - "What if we knock out Gene X?"
3. **Test it** - Set Gene X to OFF (permanent knockout)
4. **Compare** - Run again and watch the difference
5. **Explain** - "Why did Protein Y decrease when we knocked out Gene X?"

**This is NGSS Practice 2 in action**: Use a model to predict phenomena, test cause-and-effect, analyze results.

#### The Knockout Experiment Students Actually Understand

Traditional approach:
- Teacher: "Scientists knock out genes to study their function."
- Students: *nod politely, don't really get it*

**ModelIt approach**:
- Teacher: "What happens if we delete this gene from the network?"
- Student: "Let's find out!" *clicks knockout*
- Model: *entire pathway collapses*
- Student: **"WHOA! That gene was holding everything together!"**

**One of these creates understanding. Guess which one.**

### 🎯 Feature 4: Export Data for Actual Evidence-Based Arguments

**The claim**: "Students can export simulation data."

**The reality**: One click gets you a CSV file with every time step for every component.

**Why this matters**:

Your students can't write a Claim-Evidence-Reasoning (CER) argument from a pretty animation.

They **can** write one from actual data.

**The workflow**:

1. Run baseline simulation
2. Run knockout simulation
3. Click "Export CSV"
4. Open in Google Sheets or Excel
5. Create a comparison chart
6. **Write the CER**:
   - **Claim**: "Knocking out LacI increases mRNA production by 3.2x"
   - **Evidence**: "Baseline mRNA peaked at 0.42 at step 15. Knockout peaked at 1.35 at step 12" (with chart)
   - **Reasoning**: "LacI normally represses RNA polymerase. Without LacI, polymerase is always active, so mRNA accumulates faster and reaches a higher level."

**That's a real scientific argument.** With quantitative data. From a model they built or tested.

**Your admin will lose their mind.** (In a good way.)

#### The Assessment That Writes Itself

Stop grading worksheets. Start grading **model-based investigations**.

**Assignment**: "Test whether Protein X is essential for Pathway Y activation. Support your claim with simulation data."

**Student submits**:
- Screenshot of their model
- CSV export of baseline vs. knockout
- Graph comparing the two runs
- 1-paragraph CER argument

**You grade**: Model structure (5 pts), Data quality (5 pts), Reasoning (10 pts).

**Time to grade**: 2-3 minutes per student. Because they did the heavy lifting.

### 🎯 Feature 5: Collaboration That Actually Works

**The claim**: "Students can collaborate on models."

**The reality**: Multiple students can work on the same model, see version history, leave comments, and merge changes.

**This is Google Docs for biological networks.**

**Why this is huge**:

Modeling **should** be collaborative. Real science is collaborative. But most "edu tools" make collaboration impossible or clunky.

Cell Collective makes it **stupid simple**:

1. Create a model
2. Click "Share"
3. Invite students by email (or share a link)
4. Set permissions (View only or Edit)
5. Students work together, make changes, save versions
6. You see the version history to verify everyone contributed

**Group project that doesn't suck**: ✅

#### The Team Modeling Challenge That Breaks Everything (In a Good Way)

**Scenario**: You're teaching cellular respiration.

**Old way**: Everyone draws the same diagram. Boring.

**ModelIt way**:

1. **Day 1**: Each team gets a subsystem
   - Team 1: Glycolysis
   - Team 2: Krebs cycle
   - Team 3: Electron transport chain
   - Team 4: Regulation (ATP feedback)

2. **Day 2**: Teams build their subsystem models

3. **Day 3**: Teams **merge** their models into one mega-network

4. **Day 4**: Test the integrated system
   - "What happens if we block oxygen?"
   - Teams trace the cascade through THEIR subsystem
   - Someone realizes: "Oh crap, our pathway depends on Team 2's output!"

5. **Day 5**: Class presentation of the integrated model

**What students learn**:
- How biological systems are **interconnected**
- How to **coordinate** complex projects
- How subsystem failures **propagate** through networks
- Why **systems thinking** matters

**That's the kind of learning that sticks for life.**

## The 10-Minute Challenge: Build Your First Model Right Now

**Stop reading. Do this:**

### Step 1: Open Cell Collective (2 minutes)
- Go to [cellcollective.org](https://cellcollective.org)
- Click "Browse Models" or "Create New Model"
- Look around. Click stuff. You can't break anything.

### Step 2: Pick a Simple System (30 seconds)
**Suggestion**: The lac operon (gene regulation classic)

Components you need:
- Lactose (input)
- LacI Repressor
- RNA Polymerase
- mRNA (output)

### Step 3: Build It (5 minutes)
1. Add those 4 components as nodes
2. Connect them:
   - Lactose **inhibits** LacI
   - LacI **inhibits** RNA Polymerase
   - RNA Polymerase **activates** mRNA
3. Set rules:
   - mRNA is ON when RNA Polymerase is ON AND LacI is OFF
4. Save it

### Step 4: Simulate It (2 minutes)
1. Set Lactose = OFF (no sugar present)
2. Click Simulate
3. Watch: LacI is ON → blocks RNA Polymerase → mRNA stays OFF
4. Now set Lactose = ON
5. Simulate again
6. Watch: LacI shuts OFF → RNA Polymerase turns ON → mRNA goes UP

**You just modeled gene regulation.**

**In 10 minutes.**

**With no coding.**

**Your students can do this.**

## What This Looks Like on Tuesday at 10 AM (For Real)

**Scenario**: You're teaching enzyme regulation (MS-LS1-1).

### The Old Way:
1. Show a diagram of competitive inhibition
2. Students label enzyme, substrate, inhibitor
3. Hope they remember how it works
4. Spoiler: They won't

### The ModelIt Way:
1. Students open an enzyme regulation model (from the library or build one)
2. They see: Substrate + Enzyme → Product
3. You add: "Now add a competitive inhibitor node"
4. Students connect: Inhibitor **competes with** Substrate for Enzyme
5. You ask: **"What happens when we increase the inhibitor?"**
6. Students simulate:
   - Baseline: 100 substrate → 85 product
   - High inhibitor: 100 substrate → 32 product
7. Someone shouts: **"The inhibitor STOLE all the enzyme!"**

**That student just discovered competitive inhibition through modeling.**

Not memorized. **Discovered.**

## The Questions You're Definitely Asking

### "Do I need to understand biology at a PhD level to use this?"

**No.**

If you can explain a concept to your students, you can model it in Cell Collective.

The visual interface makes the logic **explicit**. No hidden assumptions. No black boxes.

### "What if students ask questions I can't answer?"

**PERFECT.**

Say: "Great question. Test it in your model and tell me what you find."

**That's inquiry-based learning.**

### "Will this take forever to set up?"

**No.**

- Use a library model: **0 minutes prep**
- Modify a library model: **5-10 minutes**
- Build from scratch: **15-20 minutes**

Compare that to creating a lab practical. Or a worksheet. Or literally anything else.

### "What if my school blocks websites?"

Cell Collective is browser-based. If your students can access Google Docs, they can access Cell Collective.

If you **do** hit a block, email us (we'll help you get IT approval with the research credentials).

### "Does this replace hands-on labs?"

**No. It complements them.**

**Best practice**:
- Use models to **generate hypotheses**
- Test hypotheses in **lab**
- Compare model predictions to **real data**
- Revise the model based on **evidence**

**That's how real scientists work.**

## Why This Actually Matters (The Big Picture)

We're not just talking about "cool tech" here.

We're talking about **how biology is actually done** in 2025:

- Cancer researchers use **network models** to predict drug combinations
- Epidemiologists use **dynamic models** to track disease spread
- Geneticists use **systems models** to understand gene regulation
- Immunologists use **pathway models** to design therapies

**This is the future of biology.**

And you're giving your middle schoolers **real experience** with professional tools.

Not "inspired by" professional work.

**The actual work.**

## Your Challenge This Week

### Step 1: Open Cell Collective (Do This Today)
Go to [cellcollective.org](https://cellcollective.org). Browse the library. Click on a model related to something you're teaching.

Just **look**.

### Step 2: Run One Simulation (Do This Tomorrow)
Open a model. Click Simulate. Watch what happens.

Then click "Perturbations." Knock out one component. Simulate again.

**See the difference.**

### Step 3: Plan One Lesson (Do This This Week)
Pick ONE concept students struggle with.

Ask yourself: **"Could they build or test a model of this?"**

If yes (and it probably is), sketch out a 15-minute modeling activity:
1. What components do students need?
2. What relationships should they connect?
3. What prediction should they test?
4. What data should they collect?

**That's it.**

You don't need a unit plan. You don't need a curriculum overhaul.

You need **15 minutes of "what if we tried this?"**
