## The Question Every Teacher Asks (And Should Ask)

You're about to use a computational modeling platform with your students.

Before you do, you want to know:

**"Can I trust this?"**

Not "Is it pretty?" Not "Does it have good reviews?"

**Can I trust that this is real science?**

**Can I trust that it won't teach my students something wrong?**

**Can I trust that when my principal asks 'What is this?' I'll have a good answer?**

**Here's the answer: Hell yes.**

And today, we're going to show you **exactly** why.

## This Isn't Khan Academy. This Is Something Completely Different.

Let's be clear about what Cell Collective **isn't**:

❌ It's NOT an educational game that "gamifies" biology
❌ It's NOT a simplified "student version" of something real
❌ It's NOT made by an edtech company trying to sell you subscriptions
❌ It's NOT an animated video series with cute characters

**So what IS it?**

✅ It's a **research platform** built at a major university
✅ It's used by **PhD students and postdocs** doing actual research
✅ It's published in **top-tier scientific journals**
✅ It's backed by **15+ years of development** and **50+ peer-reviewed papers**
✅ And it happens to have a visual interface so simple that **7th graders can use it**

**That's the magic.**

## Meet the Professor Who Started It All

**Dr. Tomáš Helikar**
University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL)
Department of Biochemistry

Back in the early 2000s, Dr. Helikar had a problem.

He was trying to understand how **thousands of proteins** in a cell work together to make decisions:
- Should this cell divide?
- Should it die?
- Should it respond to a signal?

The problem: **You can't do that in a lab.**

Sure, you can study one protein. Maybe five. But **thousands?** Interacting in networks? With feedback loops? With signals cascading through pathways?

**No lab can do that.**

You need a **computational model**.

### The Breakthrough: Make It Visual

Most computational biology in the 2000s looked like this:

```
dx1/dt = k1*x2 - k2*x1*x3 + k3*x4
dx2/dt = k4*x1 - k5*x2
...
(500 more equations)
```

**Dr. Helikar said: "What if we didn't do it that way?"**

What if instead of differential equations, we represented biology as **visual networks**?

- Nodes = components (genes, proteins, molecules)
- Arrows = relationships (A activates B)
- Logic rules = how signals integrate ("B turns ON when A is ON AND C is OFF")

**No math. No coding. Just logic.**

And suddenly, **undergraduates could build models.**

Then **high school students.**

Then **middle schoolers.**

**That's Cell Collective.**

## The Research Credentials That Make Your Principal Happy

When you tell your admin "We're using Cell Collective," here's what you can say:

### 15+ Years of Development

Cell Collective didn't pop up last year. It's been continuously developed and refined at UNL since the late 2000s.

**This is not a side project.** This is a major research initiative with sustained funding and a dedicated team.

### 50+ Peer-Reviewed Publications

The platform, the models, the methods, the educational applications—**all published in scientific journals**.

Not blog posts. Not white papers. **Peer-reviewed papers** in journals like:
- PLOS Computational Biology
- BMC Systems Biology
- Bioinformatics
- Journal of Biological Education

**What that means**: The scientific community has **scrutinized** this work. Experts reviewed it. It passed.

### Used by Researchers Worldwide

Cell Collective models have been used to study:
- **Immune signaling** (T cell activation, cytokine responses)
- **Cancer pathways** (cell fate decisions, apoptosis)
- **Growth factor signaling** (EGFR/MAPK dynamics)
- **Cell cycle control** (checkpoint regulation)
- **Metabolic switches** (glycolysis, stress responses)
- **Infectious disease** (host-pathogen interactions)

**These are real research problems.** Being solved with the same tool your students will use.

## What "Validated Model" Actually Means (And Why It Matters)

You've probably seen simulations where you click buttons and stuff happens.

**Cell Collective is different.**

Every public model in the library goes through a **rigorous validation process**:

### Step 1: Literature Curation

Researchers read **dozens to hundreds** of scientific papers about the system.

They extract every interaction:
- "Protein A activates Protein B (Smith et al., 2018)"
- "Gene X represses Gene Y (Johnson et al., 2020)"

**Every arrow in the network diagram has a citation.**

You can click on a connection and see: "This interaction is based on [these 3 studies]."

### Step 2: Model Construction

The interactions are encoded as **logical rules**:
- "B is ON when A is ON and C is OFF"
- "X inhibits Y by blocking its activation"

These rules capture the **essence** of the biological mechanism without requiring exact kinetic parameters.

### Step 3: Behavior Expectations

Researchers define what the model **should** do:
- "If we knock out Gene X, Protein Y should decrease"
- "If we activate Receptor Z, Pathway W should turn on"

These are test cases based on **known biology** from experiments.

### Step 4: Perturbation Testing

The model is tested with **simulated knockouts, overexpression, and inhibitors**.

If the model predicts outcomes that match published experimental results, it passes.

If not, **back to Step 2**.

### Step 5: Peer Review

Results are submitted to journals. External experts review the model, the logic, the validation.

**Only after passing peer review** does the model get published—and added to the Cell Collective library.

### Step 6: Public Release with Documentation

The validated model, all its logic rules, and all its references are **publicly available** in Cell Collective.

You can see:
- Every node and what it represents
- Every connection and its source
- Every rule and its logic
- Version history if it's been updated

**This is transparent science.**

## From Research Lab to Your Classroom: What Changes (And What Doesn't)

**Big question**: If Cell Collective is used for PhD research, how is it appropriate for middle schoolers?

**Answer**: The core science stays the same. The **scaffolding** changes.

### What Stays the Same ✅

- **Causal structure**: "Protein A activates Protein B" is the same in research and in class
- **Evidence trail**: Citations and references are still attached to interactions
- **Predictive power**: Knockouts and perturbations produce the same cause-and-effect outcomes
- **Visual interface**: The network diagram looks identical

### What Changes for K-12 🎯

- **Scope**: A 500-node research model might be trimmed to a 20-node classroom version focusing on key subsystems
- **Language**: Node names use grade-appropriate terminology ("Energy currency molecule" instead of "Adenosine triphosphate")
- **Scaffolds**: Preset scenarios, guiding questions, and simplified outputs help students make sense of results
- **Pace**: Research models might take weeks to build; classroom versions are built in 15-20 minutes

**Bottom line**: The **science** is authentic. The **experience** is age-appropriate.

## Real Models Your Students Can Use Right Now

These aren't made-up examples. These are **actual published models** in the Cell Collective library:

### T Cell Activation (Immune Signaling)

**What students explore**:
- Turn on a receptor → observe downstream kinase activation
- Knock out a key kinase → predict changes to cytokine output
- Compare baseline vs. knockout time series to explain cause and effect

**Real-world connection**: How your immune system responds to infections

### Apoptosis (Cell Death Pathway)

**What students explore**:
- Increase pro-death signals → trigger apoptosis cascade
- Block an anti-death regulator → see the system tip toward cell death
- Compare intrinsic (mitochondrial) vs. extrinsic (receptor-mediated) pathways

**Real-world connection**: How cancer cells evade death signals

### EGFR/MAPK (Growth Factor Signaling)

**What students explore**:
- Apply growth factor input → trace activation through the MAPK pathway
- Simulate a receptor inhibitor (like cancer drugs) → predict transcription factor changes
- Analyze negative feedback loops that attenuate the signal

**Real-world connection**: How targeted cancer therapies work

### Cell Cycle Control

**What students explore**:
- Manipulate checkpoint regulators → predict progression vs. arrest
- Introduce DNA damage → watch checkpoint activation
- Explore feedback loops that stabilize or destabilize cycles

**Real-world connection**: Why cancer cells divide uncontrollably

**These models exist. You can open them today. Your students can test hypotheses with them tomorrow.**

## The Difference Between Cell Collective and "Educational Simulations"

Most classroom simulations are **black boxes**:
- You change an input
- Something pretty happens
- The end

**You can't see the mechanism. You can't trace the logic. You can't verify the assumptions.**

**Cell Collective is the opposite**: It's a **transparent model** where:

✅ Every interaction is visible
✅ Every rule can be inspected
✅ Every assumption is documented
✅ Every prediction can be traced back to specific connections
✅ Everything can be exported and verified

**That's why it's research-grade.**

And **that's why NGSS loves it.**

## How Cell Collective Maps to NGSS Practice 2

**NGSS Science and Engineering Practice 2**: Developing and Using Models

Cell Collective hits **every dimension** of Practice 2:

### Develop Models ✅

Students construct models by:
- Adding components (nodes)
- Defining relationships (arrows)
- Writing logic rules (activation/inhibition conditions)
- Making assumptions explicit

### Use Models ✅

Students use models to:
- Predict how systems respond to inputs
- Test cause-and-effect relationships
- Generate data for analysis
- Make and evaluate claims

### Test and Revise Models ✅

Students iterate by:
- Comparing predicted results to expected behaviors
- Adjusting rules or structures based on new evidence
- Running new simulations to validate changes

### Communicate Using Models ✅

Students justify claims with:
- Model outputs (graphs, time series)
- Network structure (which connections matter)
- Cited interactions (evidence from the model's references)

**This isn't "aligned to" NGSS. This IS NGSS.**

## The Admin Observation Scenario You've Been Waiting For

Picture this:

Your principal walks in unannounced (because of course they do).

**Principal**: "What are students working on?"

**You**: "They're testing whether knocking out a cell cycle regulator prevents cancer cell division. They built a computational model based on peer-reviewed research from the University of Nebraska."

**Principal**: 😮 "Wait, what?"

**You**: "Here, look." *pulls up the Cell Collective model*

"See these connections? Each one is based on published studies. Students can click and see the citations. They're running simulations to test hypotheses, collecting data, and writing evidence-based arguments."

**Principal**: "This is... this is incredible. What standard does this address?"

**You**: "NGSS Science and Engineering Practice 2—Developing and Using Models. Plus Practice 6—Constructing Explanations. Plus Crosscutting Concept 4—Systems and System Models."

**Principal**: *furiously taking notes* "Can other teachers use this?"

**You**: "Absolutely. It's free. University-built. Research-validated. Want me to show the science department?"

**Principal**: "YES."

---

**That's not a fantasy. That's what happens when you use real science in the classroom.**

## Why "Research-Validated" Is Your Superpower

When you tell parents, admins, or colleagues that your students are using Cell Collective, you're not saying:

"We're using some cool edtech tool I found."

You're saying:

**"We're using a research platform built at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, backed by 15+ years of development and 50+ peer-reviewed publications, that's actively used by scientists studying cancer, immunity, and cell signaling."**

**One of these commands respect. Guess which one.**

## Try This Tomorrow: The 15-Minute Research Demo

Want to see the research foundation for yourself?

### Before Class (5 minutes)

1. Go to [cellcollective.org](https://cellcollective.org)
2. Click "Browse Models"
3. Find a model related to your current unit (e.g., "Apoptosis" if you're teaching cell processes)
4. Open the model

### In Class (10 minutes)

1. **Show the network** - "This model represents [system]. Each arrow is based on published research."
2. **Click Evidence** - Open the references panel for one interaction: "See? This connection comes from these studies."
3. **Run baseline** - Show students the time-course graph of normal system behavior
4. **Apply a knockout** - "What if we delete this protein?"
5. **Compare results** - "Look at the difference. Why did that happen?"

### Exit Ticket (2 minutes)

**Prompt**: "Based on the knockout experiment, what role does [knocked-out component] play in the system? Use evidence from the simulation."

**That's it.** You just did a research-backed modeling activity in 15 minutes.

## The Questions You're Thinking

### "Do I need to understand the research papers?"

**No.**

The models are annotated for educational use. You don't need to read the papers—but if a student asks "How do we know this is true?", you can **show them the citation**.

That's powerful.

### "What if the model predicts something different from my textbook?"

**Great teachable moment.**

Science evolves. Textbooks are snapshots. Models based on recent literature might reflect **new understanding**.

Use it: "Our textbook was published in 2018. This model uses 2022 studies. What changed?"

### "Can I verify this is legit before using it with students?"

**Absolutely.**

Go to [cellcollective.org](https://cellcollective.org). Browse the library. Open a model. Click "References." See the citations.

Then search "[Model Name] Cell Collective" in Google Scholar. You'll find the published papers.

**It's all there.**

## What's Coming Next Week

**Week 6: Systems Thinking Magic - "How Everything Connects (And Why Your Students Need to See It)"**

We're diving into the **big idea** behind modeling: **systems thinking**.

How to help students see biology as **networks of interactions**, not lists of isolated facts.

Why feedback loops, emergence, and robustness matter more than memorizing steps.

And how Cell Collective makes systems thinking **visible and testable** instead of abstract and confusing.

Plus: The "aha moment" when students realize **everything in biology is connected**.
